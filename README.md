🎨 Design Philosophy

This application embraces 2025 UI/UX design trends to create an immersive, visually appealing user experience:

Design Principles

Glassmorphism - Translucent, frosted-glass effect components with backdrop blur for depth and modernity
Vibrant Gradients - Dynamic, animated gradient backgrounds with floating orbs creating a lively atmosphere
Smooth Animations - Micro-interactions and transitions enhance user engagement (card slide-ins, hover effects, loading states)
Visual Hierarchy - Clear information architecture with distinct sections and intuitive navigation
Accessibility - High contrast text on gradient backgrounds, clear focus states, and responsive design
Color System

Primary Gradient: Purple → Blue → Pink spectrum
Avatar Gradients: 10+ unique color combinations (Purple-Pink, Blue-Cyan, Green-Emerald, Orange-Red, etc.)
Glass Effects: Semi-transparent whites with backdrop blur (15-25% opacity)
Text: White with subtle shadows for readability on gradient backgrounds
Typography

Font Family: Inter (weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
Hierarchy:
H1: 2.25rem (36px) - Header titles
H2: 1.5rem (24px) - Modal titles
H3: 1.375rem (22px) - Contact names
Body: 0.95-1rem (15-16px)
Animation Approach

Loading States: Multi-ring spinner with staggered rotation
Card Entrance: Staggered slide-in with scale effect (50ms delay per card)
Hover Effects: Lift transforms (-8px), scale (1.02), and enhanced shadows
Background: 15-second gradient shift animation
Micro-interactions: Button press feedback, input focus elevation, rotation effects
